# Oil Painting Techniques

Oil painting offers incredible versatility and depth. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental techniques.

## Materials

Quality oil paints, brushes, and canvas are essential. Start with a limited palette of primary colors and expand as you progress.

## Techniques to Master

1. **Underpainting**: Create a foundation with thinned paint

4. **Scumbling**: Drag dry paint over wet layers

Remember to work from dark to light and allow proper drying time between layers.
