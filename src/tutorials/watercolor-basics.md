# Watercolor Basics

Watercolor painting is one of the most beautiful and expressive art forms. In this tutorial, we'll cover the essential techniques you need to get started.

## Getting Started

The key to successful watercolor painting is understanding how water and pigment interact. Start with quality paper and paints for the best results.

## Basic Techniques

1. **Wet-on-wet**: Apply paint to wet paper for soft, flowing effects
